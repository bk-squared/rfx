# Changelog

All notable changes to `rfx-fdtd` that affect user-visible behaviour are
recorded here. Dates follow local (KST) convention. Version bumps follow
SemVer — **BREAKING** entries are flagged in upper-case.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-19

Highlights: a validation-framework **reframe** — the `broad_e5_passed`
port-external-reference verdict now means magnitude envelope + an (approximately)
convention-free phase witness + an AD-vs-FD differentiability moat + a live-physics
anchor + committed-artifact enforcement (it was a magnitude-only checkmark) — plus
machine-readable per-port physics-set validation ceilings, several
documentation-honesty corrections, a public-docs surface narrowing, and MSL /
Floquet / non-uniform / distributed test hardening. This is mostly validation rigor
and honesty; the only user-visible runtime change is a per-port reported-Z0 sign
normalization (S-parameter-invariant).

### Changed — port-external-reference validation reframe (T0–T2.5; PRs #184, #190, #186, #187, #188, #189)

- `scripts/diagnostics/check_port_external_references.py`'s `broad_e5_passed`
  verdict now requires, beyond the magnitude envelope: a documented numeric
  breadth floor (≥4 cases, ≥2 mesh, ≥2 geometry/eps, a freq-span ratio, all cases
  pass) enforced for **every** family (was waveguide-only); an approximately
  convention-free TE10 propagation-phase witness (`tests/test_waveguide_phase_gate.py`);
  an **AD-vs-FD differentiability gate wired into the verdict** (a family whose
  extractor is numpy / not-traceable — e.g. coaxial — cannot pass); a live-physics
  anchor that runs a real `compute_waveguide_s_matrix` PEC-short / empty-guide check
  rather than only replaying a frozen JSON; physics-derived (measured-envelope)
  tolerances; and git-committed-artifact enforcement (`--require-committed`) so
  evidence living only in gitignored `.omx/` no longer counts. `missing_evidence`
  now gates the verdict. (T2.4 note: the planned `C·(k·dx)²` dispersion-tolerance
  model was falsified by the committed data and replaced with a measured envelope —
  a stop-and-redesign, not a tweak.)

### Added — per-port physics-set target ceilings + usage rules (PR #191)

- The port-external manifest and auditor now declare, per family, a
  machine-readable `target_ceiling` (the validation ceiling the port can physically
  reach) and `usage_rule`, from a controlled vocabulary. broad-E5 is **not** a
  universal goal: `rectangular_waveguide_port` = broad-E5 (achieved);
  `microstrip_line_port` = broad-E5 matched-regime only; `coaxial_port` = broad-E5
  pending a differentiable API; lumped/wire = E4 natural ceiling (single-cell feeds
  have no transmission-line oracle — "validated to ceiling", not a failure);
  `floquet_port` = broadside structural-partial; generalized-planar = unimplemented.
  Descriptive context emitted alongside the verdict — it does **not** change the
  pass/block gate logic.

### Changed — public documentation surface narrowed (PR #198)

- Public `/rfx/` docs were narrowed to maintained workflows + bounded support
  envelopes: the route inventory was trimmed, generated-API and agent-deploy-sync
  surfaces removed, and public wording rewritten around documented evidence
  envelopes (temporary surfaces such as SBP-SAT subgridding stay out of user docs).
  No library behaviour change.

### Fixed — documentation honesty (T0; PRs #192, #193)

- Corrected a stale claim that the coaxial family was *"the current validated"*
  method and *"the only family currently passing the clean-checkout port
  external-reference audit"* — true only before the rectangular-waveguide broad-E5
  evidence was committed (PR #181, v1.6.4). Coaxial evidence still lives in
  gitignored `.omx/`, so the auditor reports `coaxial_port` BLOCKED and
  `rectangular_waveguide_port` is the single passing family
  (`coaxial_port` → `broad_e5_demonstrated_evidence_uncommitted` across README,
  support matrix, port-selection guide, evidence-rule doc, manifest, CHANGELOG, and
  the reference-lane doc).
- The MSL thru-line openEMS smoke comparator
  (`compare_msl_thru_openems_reference.py`) no longer reports a bare `passed` when
  its |S11| channel is non-discriminating (on a matched line the reference |S11| ≈
  the tolerance, so a degenerate output would have "passed"); it now flags the S11
  channel informational and rests on transmission. Added a committed
  estimator-level test for `rfx.harminv` (synthetic known-frequency recovery,
  float32 robustness), and corrected the cv05 metric label (a Harminv-vs-Harminv
  resonance-frequency agreement, not an S11-vs-S11 match).

### Fixed — microstrip-line reported characteristic impedance sign (issue #140, PR #194)

- `compute_msl_s_matrix` now reports a positive `Re(Z0)` on **both** ports. A `-x`
  port previously reported a negative Z0 (it inherited the sign of the
  direction-aware closed-Ampère loop current), which also false-fired the |Z0|
  honesty guard at ~228% deviation. This is **S-parameter-invariant** — the reported
  Z0 never enters S11/S21 (those use the static analytic Hammerstad-Jensen Z0); the
  genuine ~20–27% Yee-staircase Z0 warning correctly remains. A new `@slow`
  thru-line test locks |Z0| length-invariance + the positive-sign behaviour. The
  earlier PR-#134 alarm (non-physical Z0 corrupting S-params, runaway passivity) was
  verified-and-refuted; **issue #140 closed**.

### Added — validation test coverage (PRs #195, #196)

- Floquet: an extractor-level AD-vs-FD **agreement** test for
  `compute_floquet_s_params` (the differentiability moat — `jax.grad` agrees with
  central finite-difference to <1e-2 at a fixed step; previously only a finiteness
  smoke existed).
- Non-uniform mesh: an analytic-gated NonUniformGrid accuracy test against a
  **graded-axis-dependent** mode — an air PEC cavity TM111 resonance (p=1, whose
  closed-form frequency moves with the graded *z* extent, unlike the existing
  `test_stage1_nu_physics_gate` TM110 p=0 gate, which is z-independent) reproduced to
  ~2.7% on a genuinely graded mesh. This gates the graded axis against a number it
  actually changes.

### Fixed — distributed tests on a single-GPU pod (issue #162, PR #197)

- The multi-GPU `tests/test_distributed.py` tests are now device-count-adaptive
  (shard across `min(4, jax.device_count())`) and skip cleanly when <2 devices are
  present, instead of failing a hardcoded `len(devices)==4` assert on a single-GPU
  pod (where the host-device-count sentinel does not add virtual devices). The
  distributed runner is verified equivalent to single-device by the committed tests
  (rel-err ≤1e-3) — this was test brittleness, not a runner defect. The GPU suite
  goes green because the multi-device tests now SKIP cleanly on the single-GPU pod;
  reliable multi-device CI coverage is environment-gated (a known follow-up — needs
  an isolated pytest lane). **issue #162 closed**.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-16

Highlights: the rectangular-waveguide-port **broad-E5 close** (committed
analytic-Airy band envelopes + an rfx-vs-Palace-FEM external comparison, with the
port-external-reference audit GREEN for `rectangular_waveguide_port` on a clean
checkout) and removal of the orphaned legacy 3-probe MSL extractor — on top of the
accumulated correctness, preflight, AD-tape, and validation-lane work since 1.6.3.

### Added — rectangular waveguide port broad-E5 evidence, committed (PR #181, 2026-06-16)

- `compute_waveguide_s_matrix(normalize='flux')` broad-E5 evidence now survives a
  clean checkout: five WR-band (WR-28/62/15/340/10, eps_r 2 & 4) analytic-Airy flux
  envelopes (20/20 cases, max |S| diff ≤ 0.0414) committed under
  `tests/fixtures/waveguide_broad_e5/`, plus an rfx-vs-Palace-FEM broad-E4 external
  comparison across the empty / PEC-short / dielectric-slab geometry axis (max |S|
  diff 0.0707, gate 0.10). Previously this evidence lived only in gitignored
  `.omx/` outputs, so `scripts/diagnostics/check_port_external_references.py`
  reported the family `blocked` on a clean checkout while the manifest claimed
  `broad_e5_passed`; the auditor now reports `rectangular_waveguide_port` passed.
  New gate `tests/test_waveguide_broad_e5_envelope_gates.py` re-derives both
  verdicts from the committed fixtures and mirrors the auditor's broad-E5/E4
  acceptance. R5 note: coarse Meep (res 3/4) gives a non-physical PEC-short
  |S11|>1, so the converged Palace high-order FEM reference is used for that
  geometry; rfx itself is exact (|S11|=1.0000).

### Removed — orphaned legacy 3-probe MSL extractor (2026-06-15)

- Deleted the pre-issue-#80 closed-form 3-probe MSL de-embedding helpers
  from `rfx/sources/msl_port.py`: `_solve_3probe`, `msl_forward_amplitude`,
  `compute_s21`, and the unused `_integrate_v` / `_integrate_i` line
  integrals.  They had **zero callers in `rfx/`** — the production MSL
  S-matrix path uses the closed Ampère-loop current (`msl_loop_current`,
  retained) plus the SVD N-probe wave decomposition (`extract_msl_nprobe`)
  — and were only kept alive by one unit test
  (`tests/test_msl_port.py::test_compute_s21_round_trip`), removed with its
  imports.  None were exported (no `__all__`; absent from top-level `rfx`),
  so the public surface and the api-reference inventory are unchanged.
  Closes architect-review item NEW-1.

### Fixed — normalize='flux' waveguide S-matrix joins the AD tape (issue #148, 2026-06-12)

- `extract_waveguide_s_matrix_flux` is now jnp-native end to end: the
  `np.array(flux_spectrum(...))` concretizations and the in-place numpy
  S-matrix assembly are gone, so
  `compute_waveguide_s_matrix(normalize='flux', eps_override=<traced>)`
  works under `jax.grad` (previously: `TracerArrayConversionError`) —
  design loops can optimize directly through the production-recommended
  power-flux extraction instead of the normalize=False-then-validate
  workaround.
- The rewrite adds double-where guards at the two genuine gradient
  singularities (sqrt of a zero power ratio at a perfect match/null,
  angle of a zero modal ratio); primal values are preserved exactly.
- Forward regression: S-matrix unchanged vs the numpy path within the
  float-reassociation envelope (measured max|diff| 1.1e-7 on the WR-90
  fixture). New CI gates in `tests/test_waveguide_flux_ad.py`
  (composition-level grad finite + central-FD agreement ≤5% + forward
  no-op-override equivalence); support matrix `ad_evidence` updated.

### Fixed — MSL N-probe extractor NaN gradient at tiny field scales (2026-06-12)

- `extract_msl_nprobe`'s β-refinement (`_estimate_beta`) produced `nan`
  gradients when the plane-integrated probe voltages were very small
  (|V| ~ 1e-14, measured on the density-PEC/Kottke forward path): the
  float32 residual curve over the β scan went numerically flat, the
  parabolic second-difference collapsed below its 1e-20 guard, and the
  **single-where** division guard leaked `0 * nan = nan` through the
  backward pass — the exact trap class the module's `_solve_q`
  custom-JVP comment documents, reintroduced by the lstsq rewrite.
  Forward values were always finite (the failure was invisible to
  value-level checks and to unit-scale AD tests — composition-level
  only). Fixed with the double-where idiom plus scale-normalizing the
  β-estimate input (`v/max|v|`; α/γ/Z0 keep absolute scale via the raw
  final lstsq). Found by the msl_stub G2 re-run (VESSL 369367242390:
  Adam grad=nan from iter 0 while the 17-point brute scan stayed
  finite). Regression-locked by
  `test_nprobe_grad_finite_and_scale_invariant_at_tiny_v` (fails on the
  old code; locks finiteness at scale 1e-14 + scale-invariance + FD
  match).

### Fixed — cv03 flux-region congruence (issue #160, 2026-06-12)

- `examples/crossval/03_straight_waveguide_flux.py`: the rfx flux monitors
  are now bounded to the same `2*wg_width` region the Meep `FluxRegion`
  measures, instead of the full y-plane (UPML padding included). The
  full-plane `flux_in` additionally integrated the line source's radiation
  cone — power that physically exits through the transverse absorber before
  `flux_out` — so the self-transmission read 0.913 against the [0.95, 1.05]
  gate with **no flux-normalization bug present**. Measured matrix
  (resolution 10/15/20): full-plane 0.913 / 0.986 / 0.958 (non-monotonic,
  not a convergence curve); bounded 0.974 / 1.011 / 0.997 — passing at every
  resolution including the recipe mesh. Truncation witness: bounded
  resolution-10 T(f_peak) = 0.977 at 3x run length. Gate unchanged.
  Falsifier matrix: `scripts/diagnostics/cv03_flux/sweep_t_deficit.py`.
- Second comparator defect (same script, surfaced by the lane's first real
  Meep execution): the rfx integration time was slaved to Meep's
  `stop_when_fields_decayed` wall clock — when Meep stopped at t=200 the
  rfx flux DFT was truncated mid-tail and read T=1.155. rfx now runs a
  fixed 400 a/c0 units (measured band: 0.9736 at 1x, 0.9772 at 3x).
  `until_decay=1e-5` was tried and rejected for this geometry: the point
  stopper triggers at ~2200 steps while the eps=12 guide's slow tail is
  still carrying flux (T=0.745) — point-field decay is not a
  flux-convergence witness here (filed as issue #169).
- Gate statistic re-specified to the **central-band mean** T (fcen ±
  0.15·df), tolerances unchanged at 1.0 ± 0.05 and cross-diff < 0.05.
  Measured first (sweep matrix + lane runs 27393931821/27394439174): at
  the recipe mesh — 11.5 cells/λ_eff at freq_max, below the preflight's
  own ≥20 floor for flux extraction — rfx's per-bin T(f) carries the
  preflight-documented ±5-10% coarse-mesh ripple while Meep's curve is
  smooth, so the old single-bin gate sampled at Meep's peak bin landed
  in ripple valleys (0.902 at f=0.1510) even at resolutions where the
  band-energy transmission is clean (band-mean 0.966 / 1.005 / 0.989 at
  resolution 10/15/20). The band mean is the physically meaningful
  energy-transmission estimator; peak-bin values remain printed for
  information.

### Fixed — preflight 2D false positive + unit-adaptive warning text (issue #166, 2026-06-12)

- **`absorber_overlap` no longer false-trips on the collapsed z axis in 2D
  modes.** The preflight thickness mirror assumed an absorber on every
  non-PEC/PMC/periodic axis, but 2D grids collapse z to a single cell with
  no absorber at all (`Grid` sets `pad_z = 0` and strips z from
  `cpml_axes`) — so every 2D source/probe, necessarily at z=0, warned
  "near/inside UPML region" (cv03: one line per line-source point, 20 lines
  of spam per preflight). Real x/y overlap in 2D and all 3D behaviour are
  regression-locked unchanged.
- **Scale-sensitive preflight messages now pick units adaptively**
  (`_fmt_len` / `_fmt_freq`): the mesh-resolution and absorber-placement
  warnings printed fixed mm/GHz, rendering optical-scale setups as
  `dx=0.000mm`, `lo=0.0mm`, and `freq_max=74950.00GHz` — values that read
  like bugs while being correct (cv03: 100nm, 2µm, 74.95THz). Remaining
  RF-lane messages (NTFF, MSL, ports) keep mm/GHz, which is correct at
  their scale, and can migrate incrementally.
- New gates in `tests/test_preflight_structured_and_guards.py` (2D-z no
  false positive, 2D-x/y still fires, formatter units, optical-scale
  mesh-warning text).

### Fixed — waveguide-port default source spectrum (issue #150, 2026-06-12)

- **`f0=None` now defaults to the center of the requested DFT band** instead
  of the unrelated `freq_max / 2`. The old fallback could land at or below
  the port mode's cutoff (canonical WR-90 toy: 6 GHz < fc_TE10 = 6.56 GHz),
  launching an evanescent near-cutoff crawl whose extracted S-parameters were
  physically meaningless and **grew with `n_steps`** (max column power
  20 → 57 → 114 over 600 → 2400 steps on the recorded #150 toy; post-fix
  1.107, identical at 4800 and 9600 steps). Explicit-`f0` setups unchanged.
- **New preflight guards** `port_source_below_cutoff` and
  `port_freqs_below_cutoff`: the resolved source center or any requested
  measurement bin at/below the excited mode's cutoff is now flagged loudly
  (below-cutoff bins also NaN gradients under `jax.grad`).
- `examples/inverse_design/differentiable_s11_design.py` setup corrected
  (issue #149): ports moved clear of the CPML, measurement band kept inside
  the TE20 contamination bound, preflight now runs visibly and aborts on
  issues. AD↔FD relative error after the cleanup: 2.8e-4.
- New gates: `tests/test_waveguide_port_spectrum_guard.py` (preflight codes,
  f0-omitted empty-guide transmission |S21|≈1, and the #150 toy's
  column-power growth signature locked at the measured envelope).

### Current main status (2026-06-10)

- **Recommended public lane remains uniform Cartesian Yee RF/FDTD.**
  Non-uniform mesh, distributed execution, Floquet/Bloch, guarded
  subgridding, and broad inverse-design workflows remain lane-scoped and must
  be described through their support/evidence envelopes.
- **All-port broad-E5 is still incomplete.**  The external-reference audit is
  intentionally blocked until lumped, wire, MSL, Floquet, generalized planar,
  and clean-checkout waveguide artifact tracking satisfy the manifest.  Do not
  turn one port-family promotion into a blanket S-parameter claim.

### Removed — dead multimode waveguide extractor (2026-06-11)

- Deleted the internal helper
  `rfx.sources.waveguide_port.extract_multimode_s_params_normalized`.  It
  was the would-be `normalize=True` multi-mode waveguide S-matrix extractor
  but was never wired into the public API: `compute_waveguide_s_matrix`
  raises for `normalize=True` with `n_modes > 1` (cross-mode channels hit a
  0/0 in the two-run normalization) and routes multi-mode work to
  `extract_multimode_s_matrix` or `extract_multimode_s_matrix_flux` instead.
  Verified zero callers across `rfx/ tests/ examples/ scripts/ docs/`
  (only its own definition plus two docstring cross-references, now
  repointed at `extract_waveguide_s_params_normalized`).  The function was
  not exported (no `__all__` entry, absent from `rfx/api/_sparams.py`
  imports), so the public surface is unchanged.

### Added — preflight, finite-result, and automation guards (2026-06-10)

- `Simulation.preflight()` and `preflight_sparameters()` now return coded
  `PreflightReport` / `PreflightIssue` records while preserving legacy
  list-of-string behaviour.  Automation can gate on `.errors`,
  `.warnings`, `.by_code(...)`, `.raise_for_failure()`, `.to_dict()`, and
  `.to_json()` instead of scraping warning text.
- `run()` now uses the consolidated preflight path with `skip_preflight=...`,
  while preserving hard failures for structurally impossible configurations
  such as UPML + refinement and Floquet + non-uniform z.
- `Result.assert_finite()`, run/forward non-finite warnings, S-matrix
  passivity guards, and optimizer NaN-gradient recovery now surface bad
  states before they silently contaminate inverse-design loops.  Sweeps run
  preflight once and avoid repeated per-case warning floods.
- Added PR/CI guard coverage for the preflight/guard suites and re-enabled the
  tree-wide ruff lint gate.

### Added — coaxial line reflection evidence envelope (2026-06-08)

- `Simulation.compute_coaxial_line_reflection(...)` is the coaxial
  transmission-line reflection path.  Its broad-E5 physics was *demonstrated*
  (analytic Γ envelope over short/open/matched plus resistive 25/100 Ω loads,
  two characteristic impedances and mesh-resolution cases, max |Γ| dev 0.037)
  plus an independent broad-E4 MEEP power-flux short/open comparison over
  4–12 GHz (max |S11| diff 0.063).  **The evidence artifacts live in gitignored
  `.omx/` and are not committed to the repo**, so
  `check_port_external_references.py` reports `coaxial_port` BLOCKED on a clean
  checkout; do not cite this path as `broad_e5_passed` until the artifacts are
  committed and the auditor returns PASSED.  (See the 2026-06-17 documentation
  honesty correction under [Unreleased].)
- `Simulation.compute_coaxial_s_matrix(...)` remains available for backward
  compatibility but is deprecated as the older single-plane V/I path; it is
  not the promoted coaxial claims surface.

### Added — waveguide S-matrix memory control (2026-06-09)

- `Simulation.compute_waveguide_s_matrix(checkpoint_segments=...)` now
  threads segmented checkpointing through the uniform waveguide extractors.
  Regression tests pin bit-identical forward S-matrices for
  `normalize=False`, `normalize=True`, and `normalize="flux"`, finite
  gradients through `eps_override`, rejection for non-divisor segment counts,
  and a loud `NotImplementedError` on non-uniform meshes.

### Fixed — public analysis and objective correctness (2026-06-08 to 2026-06-10)

- Finite-size `FluxMonitor` bookkeeping is regression-locked as
  machine-precision equivalent to summing the same full-plane integrand window
  in standing-wave-heavy fields.  The older "finite-size flux is less stable"
  caveat is superseded by a coverage distinction: finite monitors intentionally
  exclude cells outside their requested window.
- `maximize_directivity(..., log_ratio=True)` / the log-ratio directivity
  objective fixes the wrong-sign gradient for power-changing design variables
  by differentiating the full `log(U_target) - log(P_rad)` ratio instead of a
  partially stopped absolute-power proxy.
- The MSL S-parameter AD tests are restored to CPU CI, with checkpointed tape
  usage so the lane remains covered without requiring GPU-only memory budgets.

### Fixed — waveguide port extractor correctness (2026-04-22)

- **`_co_located_current_spectrum` sign flip.**  The H-derived DFT
  correction was `exp(-jω·dt/2)`; the correct sign from the leapfrog
  timing derivation is `exp(+jω·dt/2)`.  On a lossless empty WR-90 the
  mean `∠(Z_formula / Z_actual)` on a pure forward wave drops from
  −8° to −1°.  No public API change.
- **`_shift_modal_waves` direction-awareness.**  Added a
  `step_sign: int = 1` parameter (+1 for `+x/y/z` ports, −1 for
  `-x/y/z` ports).  Previously the shift formula silently applied the
  `+x` convention regardless of port direction, producing the wrong
  sign for negative-direction ports.  Two-run normalized S-matrices
  are unaffected (the shift cancels in the device/reference ratio),
  but any external caller of `extract_waveguide_port_waves` that
  captured the single-amplitude output for a negative-direction port
  now sees the physically correct sign.
- **`_compute_mode_impedance` below-cutoff sentinel.**  Returns
  `1e30` for TE / `0.0` for TM below cutoff, replacing `jnp.inf`.
  `inf × complex(r, 0)` generated a NaN in the imaginary component
  on most NumPy/JAX implementations and cascaded into NaN
  S-parameters on any multi-mode frequency sweep that straddled a
  higher-mode cutoff.  Regression-locked by
  `tests/test_waveguide_port_validation_battery.py::test_below_cutoff_z_mode_no_nan`.
- **`_compute_beta` Yee-discrete branch.**  Optional `dt, dx` kwargs;
  when both are positive the Yee 3-D dispersion relation is used
  instead of the analytic continuous form.  Now threaded through
  `_compute_mode_impedance`, `extract_waveguide_sparams`,
  `extract_waveguide_port_waves`, and `extract_waveguide_sparams_overlap`
  so Z and β stay internally consistent.

### Changed — defaults (2026-04-22)

- **BREAKING:** `Simulation.compute_waveguide_s_matrix()` now returns
  S-parameters referenced to each port's user-facing `x_position`
  (the plane passed to `add_waveguide_port`).  Previously the default
  was the internal `reference_x_m = x_position + ref_offset·dx`
  (three cells inward), which silently phase-shifted the returned
  complex S-matrix by `exp(-jβ·3·dx)` relative to the user's port
  plane.  Users who explicitly passed `reference_plane=` on the
  port entry see no change.  Magnitude (|S_ij|) is unaffected; the
  phase convention now matches what users get from Meep's
  `get_eigenmode_coefficients` at a monitor placed at the same
  absolute position, and what any analytic formula written against
  the port plane produces.
- **`Simulation(cpml_layers=8)` → `cpml_layers=16`.**  Waveguide-mode
  CPML back-reflection measured on an empty WR-90 scales as 11.7%
  (10 layers) → 4.2% (20) → 1.8% (40).  The previous default was
  tuned for free-space simulations and was inadequate for guided-
  mode absorption.  A parallel `kappa_max` sweep confirmed
  `kappa_max > 1` degrades guided absorption in the current CFS
  formulation, so `kappa_max = 1` is preserved.  Free-space
  simulations see a modest (but monotonic) improvement in peak
  CPML absorption from the thicker default.
- **CPML polynomial order 2 → 3** (`_cpml_profile(order=3)` default
  in `rfx/boundaries/cpml.py`).  Matches the Taflove & Hagness 3rd
  ed. §7.9 recommendation for guided-mode absorbers.

### Added

- **Preflight P2.8 — waveguide-port reference-plane sanity.**
  `Simulation.preflight()` now verifies each waveguide port's
  effective reference plane lies inside the domain, outside the
  CPML absorbing region, and does not intersect a geometry box.
  Raises `ValueError` for out-of-domain; emits `UserWarning` for
  CPML or device overlap with an actionable remediation message.
- **Validation battery** (`tests/test_waveguide_port_validation_battery.py`):
  nine tests locking physical-correctness invariants with Meep-class
  gates where achievable and explicitly-ratcheted gates where the
  extractor still has a known residual.  Supersedes the older loose
  `test_passivity_*` / `test_unitarity_*` gates in
  `tests/test_conservation_laws.py` (those remain as broad
  regression detectors with a loosened lower bound to reflect the
  real extractor accuracy ceiling, documented inline).
- **Two-port contract lock** (`tests/test_waveguide_twoport_contract_v1.py`):
  three tests fixing the v1 normalized two-port invariants (empty
  preservation, PEC-short strong reflection, reference-plane
  invariance on empty guide).
- **WR-90 crossval skeleton** (`examples/crossval/11_waveguide_port_wr90.py`):
  a diagnostic reporter against analytic Airy and (when present) a
  Meep reference JSON.  Not a regression gate — gates live in the
  battery above.
- **Diagnostic scripts** under `scripts/`:
  `waveguide_port_canonical_diagnostics.py` (before/after snapshot
  harness with `--json`), `isolate_extractor_vs_engine.py`
  (empty-guide V/I spillover diagnosis, scriptable CPML and
  kappa_max sweeps), and `slab_physical_diagnostics.py` (per-freq
  rfx vs analytic vs Meep with magnitude and phase breakdown).

### Known issues (carried from earlier sessions)

- `|S11|` at resonance nulls (e.g. dielectric-slab quarter-wave
  minimum) remains ~0.05–0.10 on the default grid; halving `dx`
  locally via `dx_profile=` cuts this by ~30%.  Meep at equivalent
  resolution shows a comparable ~0.05 floor, so this is a
  shared-FDTD discretization limit, not an rfx-specific bug.
- rfx vs Meep `∠S21` residual on the WR-90 crossval slab case
  (`examples/crossval/11_waveguide_port_wr90.py`) fits a linear
  `Δφ(rad) = slope·β + intercept` model to RMS 2.3° with
  slope ≈ −5.9 mm and intercept ≈ −57°
  (`scripts/phase_offset_beta_sweep.py`).  Applying this correction
  back to the slab rfx S21 reduces the RMS phase diff from 113° to
  2.3° — VERIFIED (`scripts/verify_phase_alignment.py`).

  Decomposition against physics:
  - `exp(−j(β_slab − β_empty)·L_slab)` (material-contrast phase that
    appears in two-run normalization through a dielectric slab):
    linear-in-β fit gives slope ≈ −1.95 mm, intercept ≈ −44°
    (range −56° to −69° over the band).
  - Measured: slope ≈ −5.87 mm, intercept ≈ −57°.
  - Physics explains ~1/3 of the slope and most of the intercept;
    a residual of **−3.9 mm slope + −13° intercept** remains
    unexplained.

  Experiment 1 (2026-04-22): rfx `dx` 1.0 mm → 0.5 mm, Meep unchanged.
  Result: slope −5.87 mm → −6.0 mm, intercept −57.3° → −58.2°
  (essentially identical). **Cell-snapping / Yee-discretization
  hypothesis FALSIFIED** — the residual does not scale with rfx mesh
  size.  Remaining candidates: (a) Meep's `get_eigenmode_coefficients`
  α⁺ is referenced to a different plane than rfx assumes (cell
  centre vs monitor plane); (b) implementation difference in how
  either code handles the E/H overlap at a material-discontinuity
  edge during the two-run device/reference pair.

  The same (slope, intercept) also does NOT transfer to the
  PEC-short case (`|S11|` RMS stays 104° → 103°), so the offset is
  slab-geometry-specific rather than a universal convention shift.
  Magnitude agreement (|S21|) remains within 3–5% across the band.
  Practical guidance: compare rfx per-geometry against analytic
  Airy (where rfx matches |S21| within ≈ 5% on the slab); do not
  expect bit-level phase agreement with an external Meep script
  that has its own monitor / source-pulse conventions.

### Do-not-repeat log (carry-over from diagnosis)

- Do **not** retune `kappa_max` above 1 in pursuit of better guided-
  mode absorption under the current CFS-CPML formulation — the
  effect is **negative** (sweep evidence 2026-04-22).  Use thicker
  CPML instead.
- Do **not** treat `max|Ez|` over the full simulation window as a
  source-directionality metric — it is dominated by CPML round-trip
  reflection and has led multiple sessions in a circle.  Use an
  early-time-windowed envelope; the regression-locked version lives
  in `test_source_directionality_early_time`.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-17

(reconstructed from commit log)

### Fixed

- **Periodic boundary + CPML allocation** (`#68`): `set_periodic_axes` was
  not honoured during CPML layer allocation, causing CPML to be placed on
  periodic faces.  Preflight now detects and rejects this configuration.
  (`fix(boundary): #68 honor set_periodic_axes in CPML allocation + preflight`)

### Added

- **`distributed=True` threaded through `optimize()` and
  `progressive_optimize()`** (`#69`): the `distributed` keyword introduced
  in v1.6.2 for `forward()` is now propagated to the higher-level
  optimisation entry points.
  (`feat(optimize): #69 thread distributed=True through optimize + progressive_optimize`)

---

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-17

(reconstructed from commit log)

### Added

- **`Simulation.forward(distributed=True)` public API** (`#44`, Phase 3):
  opt-in multi-device execution via `distributed=True`.  Covers the full
  non-uniform runner: sharded grid metadata, ghost exchange, CPML on
  x-slabs, Debye/Lorentz ADE ordering contract, soft-PEC occupancy
  sharding, segmented remat + warmup + `design_mask` + `emit_ts`.
- **`progressive_optimize` multi-resolution orchestrator** (`#42`):
  `Simulation.progressive_optimize(...)` chains resolution levels with
  geometry transfer.  API demo added as crossval 08.
- **`design_mask` stop-gradient on non-design cells** (`#41`): cells
  outside the design region are hard-stopped so gradients cannot escape
  the design volume.
- **Non-uniform sentinel hardening** (`#45`): tracer-safe `dz_profile`,
  soft-PEC occupancy, and bit-identical CPML path verified against the
  uniform runner.

### Fixed

- **Multi-device grad NaN at rank-0 corners** (`#44` Phase 4): corner
  cells at rank-0 were not receiving a ghost exchange contribution,
  producing NaN gradients in distributed training runs.
- **`Simulation.__init__` host-coercion** (`#44`): closes NU sentinel #2 —
  non-uniform grid parameters are coerced to host arrays at construction
  time, preventing JIT-time shape errors.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-16

(reconstructed from commit log)

### Added

- **Preflight auto-run before `forward()` / `optimize()` /
  `topology_optimize()`** (`#66`): preflight is now invoked automatically
  by all three execution entry points; pass `skip_preflight=True` to
  suppress for benchmarking.
- **`optimize()` routed through `sim.forward()`** (`#64`): optimizer now
  uses the single differentiable forward path, removing a separate
  code branch and unifying the differentiable-path surface.
- **Simulation-time breakdown utility** (`#58`): `Simulation.profile()`
  returns a per-phase timing breakdown (CPML init, Yee loop, probe
  accumulation, post-processing).
- **Patch antenna ground-plane size sweep** (`#59`): parametric test
  verifying that ground-plane size does not affect resonance frequency
  within the validated range.

### Fixed

- **Preflight: PEC inside CPML region** (`#61`): raises `ValueError` when
  any PEC geometry box overlaps the CPML absorbing region.
- **Preflight: Taflove dispersion check** replaces the earlier ratio
  heuristic with the exact Yee dispersion criterion from Taflove &
  Hagness Ch. 4.
- **Preflight: probe-in-PEC check**; aspect-ratio threshold tightened to
  2.0:1.
- **Preflight: Courant asymmetry warning** for non-uniform grids with
  per-axis `ν` values.
- **Preflight: NU cell aspect-ratio warning** at > 2.5:1.
- **Decimated Harminv** fixes F3 post-processing OOM on fine-mesh
  convergence runs.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-16

(reconstructed from commit log)

### Added

- **Memory-efficient inverse design on non-uniform mesh** (`#35`, `#36`):
  segmented scan + remat path; `estimate_ad_memory()` gains
  `ad_segmented_gb` field (`#39`).
- **Non-uniform runner feature parity + inverse-design unblock** (`#34`):
  NU runner now supports all source/boundary types available in the
  uniform runner relevant to inverse design.
- **Per-cell `dx`/`dy` profile support** for non-uniform grids.
- **`n_warmup` stop-gradient split** (`#40`, `#56`): warmup steps are
  detached from the AD tape, preventing spurious gradients from the
  initial transient.
- **Streaming multi-frequency NTFF sweep** (`#43`, `#55`): a single
  forward pass accumulates DFT data at multiple frequencies without
  storing full time-series.
- **3D structure + far-field visualisation API** (`#38`, `#54`):
  `Simulation.visualize_structure()` and `visualize_far_field()`.
- **`minimize_s11_at_freq` objective** (`#50`, `#52`): single-frequency
  S11 proxy usable directly inside `forward()`.
- **2-port wire-port S-matrix with passive loads and direction** (`#34`
  area): `add_wire_port` supports two-port extraction with explicit
  termination impedance and `+`/`-` direction.

### Fixed

- **Physics-based resolution thresholds in preflight** (`#37`, `#53`):
  replaces heuristic cell-count thresholds with wavelength/skin-depth
  criteria.
- **Thin-PEC on non-uniform mesh** (`#48`, `#51`): rasterisation fix +
  preflight warning + mesh-aligned patch visualisation.
- **`excite=False` guards + `forward()` profile check + preflight**:
  sources with `excite=False` no longer contribute to the excitation
  sum used by normalisation.
- **`NameError` `base_materials` in differentiable forward path**.
